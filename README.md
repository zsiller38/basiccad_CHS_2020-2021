## Base
### Description
The first assignment is to create the caster base. The base's dimensions are 200 mm x 120 mm and 8 mm thick. It has 6 holes 10 mm wide and 20 mm from the edge equally spaced along the edges.

The Base

### Reflection
This was my first Onshape part and following along with Dr. Shields made it super easy. I learned about

sketching (shortcut shift-s)
constructions lines (shortcut Q)
dimensions (shortcut D)
extruding both add and remove (shortcut key E)
linear patterns (no shortcut)
Onshape is awesome. I found it really helpful to rename all my sketches. It is going to be a GREAT year in engineering.
